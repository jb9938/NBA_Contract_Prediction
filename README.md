# NBA_Contract_Prediction


# Topic
In 2016, the Golden State Warriors signed a record-breaking 54.3 million dollars 2 years
contract with Kevin Durant, a 27 years old MVP and four times NBA scoring champion
1. For an almost 24 billion dollars industry, the importance of fair monetary valuations in
player contracts cannot be overlooked2. The cost of badly overestimated player contract
does not reside only in its overvaluation but the team’s performance in its entire season.
However, the efforts to accurately predict a player’s worth have been limiting. This paper
will attempt to predict NBA contracts solely using its player statistics from the previous
year and distinguish whether these players are being over/undervalued by using machine
learning techniques.
Using machine learning techniques will allow us to take advantage of its flexibility
in non-parametric modeling as past studies in sports analytics have been done mostly
using linear regression. Ultimately, using machine learning to give accurate predictions
on players’ valuation can contribute to the reduction in market discrepancies in the NBA
contract market.

# Next Step
One of the most detrimental drawbacks of these models is the lack of avoidance of Endogeneity
in variables. Player stats are highly likely to be influenced by variables within
the model such as average play time per game. It is also not liberal of the existence of
confounding variables such as past contract values. We can adopt different varations of MLIV methods.
